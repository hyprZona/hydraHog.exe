> ⚠️ **This script is a digital gremlin. It consumes CPU & RAM like your ex eats through your Netflix account. Use it for laughs, memes, or to teach someone humility.**

## 🤖 What It Does
- Can auto-start on boot (like a clingy ex).
- Slowly maxes out **RAM** and **CPU** to 99%+ (adjustable).
- Triggers **fake warning popups** urging for a hardware upgrade.
- After 5 minutes (or whatever you set it to) of hogging, it attempts a **BSOD** (Windows crash).
- If you kill it via Task Manager? It **respawns**. Yeah. _Hydra-style._
